# AI-Generated NextJS / Supabase Project 

This codebase is AI generated. I'm exploring development with AI assistance and sharing the process publicly. So, because this is just me coding in public and experimenting with AI-generated code, there are a few things you should know: This codebase changes frequently as I learn and try new things. While you're welcome to look around and use anything you find helpful, keep in mind that I might change or break things at any time. I'm not really set up to handle contributions or provide support - it's just a personal learning project that I'm sharing openly.


## Current Features

```

4. Set up Supabase:
   - Create a new project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Copy your project URL and anon key to your `.env.local`
   - Run the necessary database migrations (if any)

5. Start the development server:
```bash
pnpm dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Project Status

I'm using this project to explore and learn, working with AI to generate and modify code. The whole thing is essentially a big experiment, which means:

- Things might break or change completely at any time
- Features might be incomplete or experimental
- I'm not able to accept contributions or feature requests
- I can't provide support or help with issues
- Feel free to use anything you find, but do so at your own risk
